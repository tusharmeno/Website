            Son Goku, born Kakarot, is a Saiyan raised on Earth and the main protagonist of the Dragon Ball series.<br>
            He is the second-born son and youngest child of Bardock and Gine, the husband of Chi-Chi, and the father<br>
            of Gohan and Goten. Originally sent to Earth by his parents as an infant, Kakarot was adopted by Grandpa<br>
            Gohan and renamed Son Goku. A head injury at an early age altered Goku's memory, ridding him of his initial<br>
            destructive nature and allowing him to grow up to become one of Earth's greatest defenders. Goku constantly<br>
            strives and trains to be the greatest warrior that he can possibly be, which has kept the Earth and the<br>
            universe safe from destruction multiple times.

                The character Goku is based on Sun Wukong, the central character of the Chinese novel Journey to the West.<br>
                To be creative with the idea of Sun Wukong, Toriyama designed Goku as a human boy with a monkey's tail,<br>
                rather than a complete simian, because the tail would give the character a distinguishing feature. He later<br>
                stated that the tail was a pain to draw, hence why he had it get cut off early on. Toriyama did not initially<br>
                plan to make Goku an alien, it was not until the introduction of fighters from other planets that he<br>
                established him as a Saiyan. Goku was given the ability to teleport to any planet in seconds, so that Toriyama<br>
                could increase the pace of the story.<br><br>

            Goku's signature attack is the Kamehameha (named after King Kamehameha I of Hawai'i), which he learned from Roshi.<br>
            The Kamehameha is a concentration of energy, released as a concussive beam. Roshi spent about 50 years developing<br>
            and perfecting the technique, but, as a child, Goku is able to understand and copy the technique immediately after<br>
            only one demonstration. After training with the Earth's Guardian, Kami, Goku learns to fly by virtue of the technique<br>
            Bukū-jutsu and uses the Nimbus cloud less frequently for flight travel.
