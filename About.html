            As the first major antagonist of Dragon Ball Z, Vegeta is the prince of an elite extraterrestrial warrior race known as the Saiyans.<br>
            As a person, he is naturally blunt, regal, hard-working and is full of his Saiyan pride; he often refers to his heritage and royal <br>
            status throughout the series, but can also have negative traits such as being extremely haughty along with a destructive temper. <br>
            He believed that he should be regarded as the strongest fighter in the universe, and becomes obsessed with surpassing Son Goku after<br>
            losing his battle with the Z fighters. However, after Frieza's death, Vegeta unites with the heroes to thwart greater threats to the <br>
            universe, most notably Cell, Majin Buu, Beerus, Zamasu, Jiren, Broly, Moro and Granolah. Throughout the series, Vegeta's role changes<br>
            from villain to later as one of the heroes, while remaining a key rival to Goku.<br>

            Toriyama initially harbored a dislike for Vegeta since he was created as a despicable character, but grew to like him as he considered the <br>
            character's personality to be straightforward, therefore easier to write. He also found the character "Extremely helpful to have around". <br>
            He stated at one point when he received a lot of fan mail telling him not to kill Vegeta, he purposely did just that. After the release of <br>
            Battle of Gods, Toriyama expressed interest in having Vegeta be the lead in the event of another animated feature, though he insisted this <br>
            was only his intent and no decision had been made.<br>
